# Assignment 3

**Introduction to Service Design and Engineering | University of Trento**

This file aims to provide a short documentation for the third course assignment.  
The original instructions can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/a/unitn.it/introsde_2016-17/lab-sessions/assignments/assignment-3).

The project was developed individually.

Server URL: [https://introsde-a3-server.herokuapp.com/](https://introsde-a3-server.herokuapp.com/)

Server repository: [https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/introsde-2016-assignment-3-server](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/introsde-2016-assignment-3-server)

## Project structure

The project repository is made up of the following *files* and **folders**:
* **src/introsde/assignment/test**: client Java source code
    * *Main.java*: client main running requests
* *build.xml*: Ant configuration file containing task definitions (see next paragraph)
* *client-log*: client execution log
* *ivy.xml*: Ivy configuration file containing client dependencies
* *README.md*: this file

The project is composed of two parts: a client and a server. They communicate by exchanging some Transfer Objects.
These are POJOs representing the common interface the two side of the application share.

Client classes are automatically generated by using the *wsimport* tool and are not present in the git repository.

The client application executes requests to the server and logs the result of these operations in the *client.log* file.
Every server method is executed at least once.


## Project tasks

Some Ant tasks are defined inside *build.xml*. An overview of what each task does follows. Tasks' dependencies are in brackets:
* *download-ivy*: downloads Ivy jar from the Maven repository
* *install-ivy* (*download-ivy*): adds Ivy jar to the working directory
* *retrieve.client* (*install-ivy*): downloads ivy dependencies for client
* *init.client* (*retrieve.client*): initializes client workspace
* *get-wsdl.client* (*init.client*): automatically generates classes from WSDL with *wsimport*
* *compile.client* (*get-wsdl.client*): compiles client code 
* *execute.client* (*compile.client*): executes client requests to server


## How to run

Deploy the server on Heroku following the [server instructions](https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/introsde-2016-assignment-3-server/blob/master/README.md).

To run the code simply clone this project into your computer with:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ShadowTemplate/introsde-2016-assignment-3-client
$ cd introsde-2016-assignment-3-client
```

To execute client requests run the *execute.client* Ant task:
```
$ ant execute.client
```
